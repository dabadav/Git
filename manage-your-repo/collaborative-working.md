# Collaborative working

The single biggest selling point of GitHub is its set of project collaboration features, including version control and access control.

To illustrate what’s possible with GitHub, imagine this scenario: You want to code up an online game, and you enlist your friend to help you. You create a **repository** on GitHub that stores all the files, including current and past versions, then give your friend collaborator access to this repo as well.

You decide to work on the main gameplay and screens while your partner tackles the game’s menu and settings screens. In order for you both to push your changes at the same time without interfering with the other’s work, you create a **branch** — a separate development area — where your teammate can build out their screens. Meanwhile, you continue work in your branch.

Once your friend finishes their work, they can make a **pull request** asking to combine their work with yours. If you approve, you can **merge** your branches, and thus your code.

Now, say another developer sees your game’s repository and has an idea to add multiplayer mode. They can **fork** — or make their own copy of — your repository, then add their new features. Once finished, they can submit a pull request to you. If you approve, this forked repository merges with yours, and your game is now multiplayer! Note that anyone can fork a public repository, but it's up to the repository owners to accept or reject pull requests.

Of course, no software is perfect on the first go, which is why your GitHub repo also has an **Issues** section for listing to-dos and reporting problems with your game, discussing them, and marking them resolved. To address these issues, you might look back at a file’s changelog to see when and where things went wrong.

To sum up, GitHub provides a centralized space where several, dozens, or even thousands of developers can seamlessly contribute to a project, without worrying about overriding anyone’s work or losing track of changes.
