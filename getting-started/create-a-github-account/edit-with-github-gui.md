# Edit with GitHub GUI

In addition to being a host for Git content, GitHub includes a very straight forward code editor.

Let's try to edit the `README.md` file in GitHub. Just click the edit button:

Add some changes to the code, and then `commit` the changes. For now, we will "Commit directly to the master branch".

Remember to add a description for the `commit`:
